        <p>Welcome{{ repeat }}, {{ name }}!</p>
        <p>Thank you for joining in celebration of our upcoming wedding. We are so excited to share this special day with you. Please use this website to help you plan the details of your journey to Vail.</p>
        <div class="covid">
            <p>We are closely monitoring the current public health concerns. The safety of our family and friends is our top priority. We are working hand-in-hand with Vail Resorts and all of our vendors to proceed with our wedding cautiously while abiding by the guidelines provided by Eagle County and the State of Colorado as the circumstances progress.</p>
            <p>While the ceremony and most of the reception will take place outdoors, we will be strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines during both, and we want you to be as comfortable as possible during our celebration! With that in mind, please <a href="mailto:hello@kathrynandrob.com">send us an email</a> if you have any questions about how we will respond or have concerns about attending. If you decide that you are not comfortable attending either the ceremony or the reception, we completely understand and simply request that you let us know as soon as possible to help us plan ahead. We wish you all good health during these uncertain times, and can't wait to celebrate with you this fall!</p></div>
        <p>We will continue to update this website as we get closer to our big day, so please check back later (<a href="mailto:hello@kathrynandrob.com">or let us know!</a>) if you can't find what you're looking for.</p>
        <p>With love,</p>
        <p>Kathryn & Rob</p>
